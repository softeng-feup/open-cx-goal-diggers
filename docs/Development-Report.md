## Product Vision

To make great questions heard (by the speaker)


## Elevator Pitch

Tired of the long awkward silences when speaker asks "Any questions??"; Tired of hearing the front line old lady telling her life story taking up your question space? Don't worry!! Send us your questions and upvote your favorites. Make your voice heard without the hassle of waiting for a mic.

## [Public Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Jtdu8VDQec&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR1-Mc5Pf7NjWfPYQs7GwKFiovtZ_Y6ICs5jEF5wPnnWPZnVumXX50vyZtQ)

## Requirements


UpQuestion was designed to end up with the inefficient experience of the participants in a conference at the end moment when questions are made/answered.

The main stakeholders identified in the given context are:

* The Participant- Person who attend to listen the speaker in   a certain talk. Has the capability to Submit questions and   to upvote other participants questions he thinks deserve     being answered.

* The Speaker- Person expert on the subject who performs the   talk. Has limited time to answer an, also, limited number     of questions and intend to invest that time to answer the     most interesting questions.

We believe that a communitarian forum open to all conference participants with features of upvote is our greatest ally to cluster the greatest questions, those that will be answered in that limited period.

A more detailed analysis of this topic is made below targeting RUP & AGILE methodologies of requirement engineering:


### Use Case Diagram
![Use Case Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/QCCtZqq.jpg =400x400)


 *Fig.1: Use Case Diagram*

#### Ask Questions
* **Actor**. Any user attending a lecture.
* **Description**. The purpose of this use case is to make questions and saving all of them on a list
* **Preconditions and Postconditions**. Users first need to login, which they can do using twitter. Then they need to choose from the schedule the lecture they are attending. Finally they need to click the plus button. In the end the system will add the question to the list. When the lecture is over, users can't ask questions anymore.
* **Normal Flow**. After the plus button is clicked, the system will open a pop-up with a box for a user to write a question. Then the user can click on the button to share the question and the system will close the pop-up and add the question to the list.
* **Alternative Flows and Exceptions**. In the pop-up there is a checkout box that, when clicked, the user will be able to share the question anonymously. There is also another button to share the question, that will share it also with twitter. If the user is not logged in with twitter, the system will show an error message.

#### See Questions
* **Actors**. Any user attending a lecture and the speaker who is giving it.
* **Description**. The purpose of this use case is to make all the questions visible for everyone who is in the lecture.
* **Preconditions and Postconditions**. Users first need to login, which they can do using twitter. Then they need to choose from the schedule the lecture they are attending. All the questions can be seen even after the lecture is over.
* **Normal Flow**. After choosing the lecture from the schedule, the system shows a list of all the questions made at the moment, sorted by number of votes. The system is always updating this list, as more questions are made.
* **Alternative Flows and Exceptions**. The sorting can be changed by the user, when clicked the sorting dropdown box. It allows the user to select from 'Top', 'Trending' and 'New', to which the system will update the questions order, based on the option selected.

#### Vote on Questions
* **Actor**. Any user attending a lecture.
* **Description**. The purpose of this use case is to be able to vote on the questions.
* **Preconditions and Postconditions**. Users first need to login, which they can do using twitter. Then they need to choose from the schedule the lecture they are attending. When the lecture is over, users can't vote on the questions anymore.
* **Normal Flow**. After choosing the lecture from the schedule, the system shows a list of all the questions made at the moment, sorted by number of votes. Users can click on upvote and downvote on all the questions and the system will update the number of votes and the order of the list.

#### Answer Questions
* **Actor**. The speaker who is giving the lecture.
* **Description**. The purpose of this use case is to be able to answer the questions.
* **Preconditions and Postconditions**. Speakers first need to login, which they can do using twitter. Then they need to choose from the schedule the lecture they are giving.
* **Normal Flow**. After choosing the lecture from the schedule, the system shows a list of all the questions made at the moment, sorted by number of votes. At the end of each lecture, speakers can answer this questions to clarify the audience.
* **Alternative Flows and Exceptions**. After the lecture is over, speaker can answer the questions, by clicking on the comment button of a giving question.


### User stories

We are using Trello to keep track of the user stories in the state of:

* Planed of (Backlog)
* Under Work (Doing)  
* Done. 

You have a [link](#Tasks-Management-Tools) to check all the dashboard bellow, but here we brief you that information with a screenshot of our Trello's user stories organization. 




#### First-sprint

&nbsp;In the first sprint our focus was on implementing the prototype. That demanded to architecture the future design under we would code into, an MVC one, using a local DataBase, implement the UI designed in the mockups from the inception phase, which means we built the prototype with the fundations required for many of the user stories with the greastest interaction with the user such as login

In terms of user stories, we implemented the following: [Iteration #1](https://trello.com/b/08Qa7QyI/esofupquestion?menu=filter&filter=label:Iteration1) 


#### Second-sprint

&nbsp;The second iteration we project from the results of [Iteration #1](https://trello.com/b/08Qa7QyI/esofupquestion?menu=filter&filter=label:Iteration1) . We decide to implement a firebase backend, according the reasons stated here, that required to redefine the implementation of the user stories completed in the first iteration to work using a real time database as firebase. 

Furthermore, we decide to move forward and implement in the following user stories: [Iteration #2](https://trello.com/b/08Qa7QyI/esofupquestion?menu=filter&filter=label:Iteration2)

#### Third-sprint
&nbsp;The third iteration focused on the development of the reply capability to any question previously made, the integration of the twitter’s related capabilities and also the the implementation of constrains to the register form. 

&nbsp;In UpQuestion at the time of the third iteration, only the speaker has the capability to reply to questions. Furthermore, that capability is constrained to talks where he responsible for. In order to increment this feature, it was necessary to include the capability to distinguish a simple user from a speaker. In order to achieve that objective, a special speaker-login system based on a code stored in the database was designed.


&nbsp;The implementation of restrictions to the register form parameters (username, password and email) was also achieved supported in the REGEX embedded libraries offered by flutter. 
About the twitter’s subject, we were unable to achieve any progress on that, since the Twitter API key wasn´t released in time by the Twitter team. We look forward to implementing them as soon as the mention key would be released.


##### The original plan is represented in the following Trello schedule:

#### Fourth-sprint
&nbsp;The fourth iteration was the stabilizing iteration. The main goal was to sharp every feature implemented during the previous iterations, in order to make the app in a 1.0 version ready to share to the openCX open project.  

##### Stabilizing things included:

* Remove the graphical foundation of the Twitter feature that we initial thought we could implement in our project. [Explained here].
* Improve the UI experience.
* Refactoring the code to a more fashion way, 
* In terms of addictions to the project:
* Now its possible to remove questions previously done.
* A stable version of the speaker authentication has been added, now his login-state is preserved between navigation in the page. There is no need to authenticate each time he acess the page no more.
* A final version of the reply form, now it’s possible to see, with an improved UI experience, what the speaker is replying.

##### The original plan is represented in the following Trello schedule:

#### Fifth sprint

The fifth and last iteration of UpQuestion was divided into two major purposes:
* Integration in the major open-CX app
* Refactoring and documenting the code and development report.

Regarding the first topic our group because of the similarity with other group [Jakepaulers](https://github.com/softeng-feup/open-cx-jakepaulers), decided to contact them directly, in order to schedule work that could maximize efficiency. From that contact, it was agreed that our group should implement the anonymous question feature and improve the way the question deletion is made, as a simple sliding.




##### The final status of plan to this iteration can be seen in the following trello [link](https://trello.com/b/08Qa7QyI/esofupquestion?menu=filter&filter=label:Sprint%204%20-%206%20de%20dezembro)

&nbsp;Furthermore, in this iteration we design the oficial demo for our app. You can check it [here](#Public-Demo) on the Public-Demo section.


 ### Mockups
 
 The mockups for this project were developed in Figma and can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/BlnF2GOIbviAUOwevrIHnR/UpQuestion?node-id=0%3A1). 
 <br> (or, as an alternative, in the folder [mockups](https://github.com/softeng-feup/open-cx-goal-diggers/tree/master/docs/mockups) of this directory)

 
## Architectural Structure & Design


### Logical-Architecture

#### MVC

&nbsp;We are developing code bearing in mind the MVC architectural structure. At the time of this first report, it is revealing itself harder than we anticipated the division between the View and Controller due to the code structures that Flutter implies. More refactoring will be done in the next iterations.

&nbsp;After the implementation of the firebase backend, many feature were added to the controller component side of Upquestion.
#### Backend

&nbsp; An application as UpQuestion with the aim of manipulate multiple questions in different talks will generate a huge amount of data easily. Furthermore, for testing purposes, a local static database is a nonsense further than the prototyping phase. The effective test to evaluate the practicability of our design is made submitting plenty of questions, and, then, manipulate it simulating the role of user and speaker.

&nbsp; For these reasons, we decided to move forward and integrate in our Flutter App an online backend software that could resolve the greatest number of user stories as possible. The decision made was integrate Firebase from Google(same producer of Flutter).

&nbsp; Firebase is a backend API with support to Flutter that provide between plenty of services, two very interlinked with our goals, authentication services with email/password, but also with twitter (that we will yet explore), furthermore, it provides the capability to store data in a NoSQL structure.

### Physical Architecture

&nbsp;In UpQuestion there is a simple physical architecture since we are not using any kind of hardware or even any specific feature of the host smartphone. The following diagram shows a high-level schema of the app physical architecture:

#### Deployment Diagram UML

### Prototype

&nbsp;The prototyping building phase was made during the iteration 0 after building an joining an initial collection of user stories, the group decided to use the film of the navigation through the different menus with responsive button to actions feature of FIGMA  in order to build a practical graphical and intuitive first prototype of UpQuestion without a single line of code. 

&nbsp;There we can already watch the initial sketch of the implementation of user stories such releated with questions, votes, conference selection, login and twitter connection. [User Stories](#User-stories) 

With that practicable feature always in mind the group was able to check on every iteration that every user story initial design in prototype was implemented, and more important than that receive immediate feedback of the deviance from the original plan in every flutter implementation.

You can check our prototype in FIGMA using the invitation link below, but since you require login in FIGMA to do that, we also post some photos demonstrating the referred slideshow. [Link](#https://www.figma.com/proto/BlnF2GOIbviAUOwevrIHnR/UpQuestion?node-id=94%3A2&scaling=scale-down)

![](https://i.imgur.com/ASAEVSH.png =300x450)
![](https://i.imgur.com/eXlquk1.png =300x450)


&nbsp; By the end of the first iteration we were able to replicate in flutter code as much as we could these features that the prototype includes. The decision of which user stories complete firstly was based on the priority scheduled established in the iteration zero. [Link for the first iteration results](#First-sprint) 

## Test
In order to test the features developed throughout each iteration, and thus to see if the user stories were fullfiled, some tests were prepared with that intent.

These tests were automatized with the support of Gherkin that gives the oportunity to assemble tests in a much more readable way. 

Gherkin makes tests more readable given they are written in a more human friendly way.

However, Gherkin falls short when testing applications written in Flutter/Dart that use a database service, given that, to our understandment, the test driver can only identify widget modifications and isn´t able to do the same with data modifications.

Nevertheless, some features were tested (which are listed bellow) by inducing modifications and then finding them executed in the widget tree.

Tested features:
* User Login
* Activity Conection
* Ask Question
* Ask Anonymous Question
* Vote a Question
* Consult Most Voted Question
* Reply Question

## Tasks Management Tools
To communicate more efficiently we chose to use **Trello**  as our main tool of tasks management. 

As mention above, we made use of trello, also, to store the information of the user stories, dynamically organized in three types of status
* Planed of (Backlog)
* Under Work (Doing)  
* Done.

User Stories with their BDD text, User Case Diagram and the work flow can be found [there](https://trello.com/b/08Qa7QyI).
